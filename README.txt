Hi there,

this is my mooshimeter-python playground.


Setup / Dependencies:
 -- Python 2.X ( I use 2.7 )
 -- MooshimeterAPI
 -----> Check out the prerequisites in MooshimeterAPI/README !
        MooshimeterAPI is already included as a submodule.
 -- numpy
 -----> On Windows, the C++ Compiler from http://aka.ms/vcpython27 is a prerequisite
        Run â€œpython -m pip install numpy in the command line (needs pip to be installed, but is already included in up-to-date python installations)
		

Kind regards,
Kajetan
