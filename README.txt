Hi there,

this is my mooshimeter-python playground.


Setup / Dependencies:
- Python 2.X ( I use 2.7 )
- MooshimeterAPI
  - Check out the prerequisites in MooshimeterAPI/README !
  - MooshimeterAPI is already included as a submodule.
- numpy
  - On Windows, the C++ Compiler from http://aka.ms/vcpython27 is a prerequisite
  - Run “python -m pip install numpy" in the command line (needs pip to be installed, but is already included in up-to-date python installations)
- matplotlib
  - Run “python -m pip install matplotlib" in the command line (needs pip to be installed, but is already included in up-to-date python installations)
		

Kind regards,
Kajetan
